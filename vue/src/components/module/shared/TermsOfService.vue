                                                referral payment by CloseFriend to the Referring User of US$50,000 per Referred Creator.<br/>
                                                This means that if a Referred Creator generates Friend Payments with a total value of US$1 million or more in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of CloseFriend, then the
                                                Referring User's referral payments in relation to that Referred Creator will be capped at US$50,000 in total. However, if the Referred Creator generates Friend Payments with a total value of less than US$1 million in the twelve
                                                months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of CloseFriend, then the Referring User will be paid five per cent. (5%) of the Friend Payments generated by that Referred Creator in the twelve
                                                months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of CloseFriend, following which no further referral payments will be made to the Referring User in respect of that Referred Creator.<br/>
                                                For all referrals made prior to 1 May 2020, we will make referral payments to the relevant Referring Users until 1 May 2021 or until US$50,000 has been paid out by us to the Referring User on the referral, whichever occurs
